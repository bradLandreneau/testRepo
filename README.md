# videoTranscoding
This repo is used for practicing git techniques and keeping track of various scripts/programs that transcode video.  
Here you can find various methods in C# and Python that will manipulate video via FFMpeg.  Note that instead of C# or Python you can use the command line!  

If you are going to try to run one of the scripts as is, make sure you update the directory information and that you have both FFMpeg and Phil Harvey's ExifTool installed and in your %PATH. 

Check the wiki for more information!
